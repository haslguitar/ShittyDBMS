# ShittyDBMS
The intent of this project is to learn C++.  ShittyDBMS is a database management system that is crossplatform.  It can be extended to have io and storage on different platforms by deriving a new class from IOHandler and StorageHandler respectively.

## Compilation
Currently: `g++ main.cpp IOHandler.cpp PlatformSpecificIO.cpp`
